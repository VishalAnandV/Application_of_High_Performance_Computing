## Implementataion of High Performance Computing 

This project focuses on the implementation of a High-Performance Technical Computing solution on an HPC cluster, utilizing MPI to parallelize the travelling salesman problem.

### Structure:

- 'BruteForce' contains the brute force implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem
- 'Branch_and_Bound' contains the branch and bound implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem
- 'input' contains the input files for the algorithms from 4 to 18 cities
